---

Flowbite is a library of components built on top of the utility-classes from Tailwind CSS and it also includes a JavaScript file that makes interactive elements works, such as modals, dropdowns, and more. Learn how to get started by following this quickstart guide.

## Getting started

Flowbite can be easily integrated into your project through NPM. It functions as a plugin for Tailwind CSS and offers both a data attributes interface and a JavaScript API for powering interactive UI components.

### Require via NPM

Make sure that you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow">Tailwind CSS</a> installed.

1. Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:

```bash
npm install flowbite
```

2. Require Flowbite as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require('flowbite/plugin')],
};
```

3. Additionally to your own `content` data you should add `flowbite` to apply the classes from the interactive elements in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js'],
};
```

4. Require the JavaScript code that powers the interactive elements before the end of your `<body>` tag:

```html
<script src="../path/to/flowbite/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

### Include via CDN

The quickest way to get started working with FlowBite is to simply include the CSS and JavaScript into your project via CDN.

Require the following minified stylesheet inside the `head` tag:

```html
<link
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/{{< current_version >}}/flowbite.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

And include the following JavaScript file before the end of the `body` element:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/{{< current_version >}}/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

Please remember that the best way to work with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite is by purging the CSS classes.

### Bundled JavaScript

One of the most popular way of using Flowbite is to include the bundled Javascript file which is UMD ready using a bundler such as Webpack or Parcel which makes sure that all of the data attributes and functionality will work out-of-the-box.

You can directly import the main JavaScript file inside your bundled `app-bundle.js` file like this:

```javascript
import 'flowbite';
```

This file has access to all of the components and it automatically applies event listeners to the data attributes.

### Data attributes

The preferred way to use the interactive UI components from Flowbite is via the data attributes interface which allows us to add functionality via the HTML element attributes and most of the examples on our documentation applies this strategy.

For example, to set up a modal component all you need to do is use `data-modal-target` and `data-modal-{toggle|show|hide}` to toggle, show, or hide the component by clicking on any trigger element.

### Init functions

You can also use the init functions to set up the event listeners yourself. Here's an example how you can do it with Vue or Nuxt:

```javascript
<script setup>
import { onMounted } from 'vue'
import { initFlowbite } from 'flowbite'

// initialize components based on data attribute selectors
onMounted(() => {
    initFlowbite();
})
</script>

<template>
    // Modal HTML markup with data attributes from Flowbite
</template>
```

The `initFlowbite` function sets up all of the init functions for dropdowns, modals, navbars, tooltips and so on to hook onto the data attributes. Alternatively, you can also initialise each component category class separately with `initDropdowns` or `initModals`.

You can view more examples by browsing the [components from Flowbite](#components).

### ESM and CJS

Flowbite also offers an API for using the components programmatically and it supports both CJS and ESM for JavaScript which can be helpful if you need to expand the default capabilities of the data attributes interface and get access to function callbacks.

Here's an example how you can import and create a new Modal component inside JavaScript:

```javascript
import { Modal } from 'flowbite';

const $modalElement = document.querySelector('#modalEl');

const modalOptions = {
  placement: 'bottom-right',
  backdrop: 'dynamic',
  backdropClasses:
    'bg-gray-900 bg-opacity-50 dark:bg-opacity-80 fixed inset-0 z-40',
  onHide: () => {
    console.log('modal is hidden');
  },
  onShow: () => {
    console.log('modal is shown');
  },
  onToggle: () => {
    console.log('modal has been toggled');
  },
};

const modal = new Modal($modalElement, modalOptions);

modal.show();
```

Check out the JavaScript behaviour section of each component's page to learn how you can use this.

### TypeScript

Flowbite supports type declarations for the interactive UI components including object interfaces and parameter types. Check out the following examples to learn how you can use types with Flowbite.

Additionally to our code above, we will now import some relevant types from the Flowbite package, namely the `ModalOptions` and `ModalInterface`:

```javascript
import { Modal } from 'flowbite';
import type { ModalOptions, ModalInterface } from 'flowbite';

// other code
```

Learn more about Flowbite and TypeScript in the [quickstart guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/typescript/).

## Tailwind CSS 2.0

Flowbite works with the 2.x version of Tailwind CSS.

## Tailwind CSS 3.0

Feel free to upgrade to version 3 of Tailwind CSS as there are no breaking changes when using the components from Flowbite.

## WindiCSS

Flowbite also works with WindiCSS. Just include the WindiCSS version of the Flowbite plugin inside the `windi.config.js` file.

```bash
plugins: [
    require('flowbite/plugin-windicss')
],
```

## Figma design system

The components from Flowbite are first conceptualized and designed in Figma using the latest features such as variants, auto-layout, grids, responsive layouts, and more.
